## Methods of Entry
- Overt entry is when the method of entry causes damage or destruction. This could be damage or destruction to locks, doors, windows, walls or other objects.
- Covert entry is usually undetectable to un-trained people. However, during a forensic investigation by trained professionals, the method of entry would be discovered.
- Surreptitious entry is when the method of entry is undetectable to both un-trained and trained people. This method would most likely go unnoticed even during a forensic investigation.
